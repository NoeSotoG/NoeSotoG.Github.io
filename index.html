<h1>Cars</h1>
<p>Cars are a common type of transportation that use four wheels and an engine to move. There are many different types of cars, including sedans, SUVs, coupes, and convertibles, each designed for different purposes and lifestyles. Cars can run on various types of fuel, such as gasoline, diesel, electric, or hybrid, and can have different features and technologies, such as air conditioning, navigation systems, or advanced safety features. Despite their convenience, cars can also have negative impacts, such as pollution, traffic congestion, and accidents, and alternatives like public transportation and walking should be considered for sustainable and healthy living.</p>
